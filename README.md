With nearly 350,000 employees across 30,000 retail locations, Starbucks is one of the largest multinational chains of coffeehouses in the world. One of the key resources is their employees at Starbucks. Starbucks calls their employees partners because employees are all partners in shared success. Part of the Starbucks experience is walking into a store and being greeted by great employees that know your name and your favorite drink. In other words, the longer a partner works at Starbucks, the more relationships they build and experiences they contribute to which translates into better customer experiences, increased competitive advantage, and greater customer lifetime value.

Our question to  resolve throught this project is "how can Starbucks predict when high-value employees are at risk of leaving, so that steps can be taken to minimize turnover?"

Starbucks has a relatively high turnover rate of 65 percent for full-time partners. It costs as much as 33% of a worker's annual salary to replace. If we assume this statistic holds true for Starbucks, employee turnover could be costing them approcimately $2 billion per year and reduce this by just 0.1%, it could mean saving of $ 2 million per year.
